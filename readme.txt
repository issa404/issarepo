This is my read me file. 

Ok, it's quite empty in here. 


That's cool, though. Let's put some info : 
$ git init – creates a local repo
$ git status – checks on what has changed since last commit
$ git add <xxxxxxxxx > - adds the list of files 
 	git add –all   - adds all files
	git add *.txt  - adds all .txt files in current directory
	git add “*.txt.” – adds all txt files in the whole project
